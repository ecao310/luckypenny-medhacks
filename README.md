# Welcome to Food Friends with Me

## This service aims to address two important issues in healthcare:

### 1. Providing a way for patients to self-track their health records
What can you do to control your own health? And how can we help you achieve your goals?

Create an account with diet plan and general location

Create a checklist food plan

Check off daily goals (e.g. calorie intake, iron intake, etc.) 

Provide and summaries/averages for the last 30 days (or whatever time period) so when the patient goes to the doctor, they can show the physician how their diet is going

Present to doctor later


### 2. Connecting people with similar dietary interests for peer-motivation
